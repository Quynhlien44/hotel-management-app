### **Project Plan: Hotel Room Reservation Application**

### **1. Project Overview**

- **Project Name**: StaySmart
- **Purpose**: Create a simple, user-friendly system that allows customers to manage hotel room reservations with ease. This will also provide hotel staff a tool to streamline room management and booking tasks effciently.
- **Scope**: Initial development will focus on a console-based backend application, with potential future expansion into a web or mobile interface. The application could also integrate with payment gateways and offer advanced reporting features.
- **Development Approach**:  The initial version will be developed as a backend application using Node.js. In future iterations, it can be integrated into a web-based front-end (using technologies like Express, React, or Angular) or mobile applications. Database management will use either MongoDB for scalability, with potential migration to cloud platforms like Azure

### **2. Objectives**

- Implement a system where customers can:
    - Check real-time room availability based on date ranges.
    - Find best options according to their requirments.
    - Booking and cancellation features.
- Provide hotel staff the ability to:
    - View current room availability and customer details.
    - Update room statuses (vacant, reserved, occupied).
    - Generate and view daily, weekly, and monthly booking reports.

### **3. Project Deliverables**

- **Functional Application**: A fully operational Node.js backend application with APIs to handle room availability, reservations, and staff management.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanation of code, how the system works, and the final report.
- **Presentation**: Final presentation showing the functionality, code structure of the system.

### **4. Major Milestones**

| Milestone | Description | Completion Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Project Planning** | Defining scope, objectives, and technology stack. | Week 1 |
| **Design Phase** | Define system architecture, objects, and functions. | Week 2/3 |
| **Development Phase** | Implement core features (API routes, database models, services) | Week 4/5 |
| **Testing Phase** | Test core functions, fix bugs, and refine system. | Week 6 |
| **Documentation & Presentation** | Prepare final project documentation and presentation. | Week 7 |

### **5. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Project Manager**: Coordinates the team and oversees progress (Your role or group leader).
- **Developers**:  Design and implement API routes, database models, and services (Team members).
- **Tester**: Ensures all features work as expected through unit, integration testing (Everyone in the team).

### **6. Development Tools and Technologies**

- **Programming Language**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js for backend API development.
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code.
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB to store room and customer information.
- **Testing Tools**: Console testing, manual validation of functionality.

### **7. Risk Management**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope Creep** | Delays project delivery. | Keep scope simple and focused on essential features. |
| **Buggy Code** | Reduces user experience. | Regular testing after each task. |
| **Time Constraints** | Project not completed on time. | Stick to the timeline, track progress regularly. |

### **8. Testing Plan**

- **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions (e.g., room booking, room availability checking).
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure database operations and API endpoints work together.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Conduct final tests with potential users to gather feedback and ensure usability.

### **9. Timeline**

| Task | Duration | Responsible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Project Planning** | 1 week | Project Manager |
| **System Design** | 2 week | Developers |
| **Core Development** | 2 week | Developers |
| **Testing & Refining** | 1 week | Developers, Tester |
| **Final Presentation** | 1 week | Entire Team |
